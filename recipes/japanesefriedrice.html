    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups jasmine rice</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>1.5 cups water</li>
        <li>4 tbs butter</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tbs veg. oil</li>
        <li>3 tbs sesame seeds</li>
        <li>2 tbs soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place rice, chicken stock, and water in a medium saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and
            simmer until tender and liquid has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat, stir in 2 tablespoons butter, and let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add eggs and scramble, stirring often to chop chunks of
            egg into small bits with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Place rice in a large mixing bowl, add eggs, and toss together.</li>
        <li>Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Dump rice mixture into the
            hot pan. Add sesame seeds, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring often, for 8 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Taste and add more butter or soy sauce as desired. Serve.</li>
    </ol>
